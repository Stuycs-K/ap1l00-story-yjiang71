Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no dog
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on dog, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the dog. It is a way I have of driving off the
dog and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the dog; 
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN>; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> before coffin dog, and bringing up the rear of every <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN> I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the dog, and methodically
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's dog off—then, I account it high time to get to dog as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all dog in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the dog with me.
